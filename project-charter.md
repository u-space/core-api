## Project purpose

We aim to make airspace as open as possible to unmanned aircraft

## Project objectives

We aim to develop an “easy to deploy” UTM solution for supporting humanitarian drone operations around the world.


We aim to create a community of UTM suppliers that contributes with different pieces of the UTM ecosystem to make UTM/Space development cheaper
We aim to integrate different drone manufacturers with our remote Identification API.

All related to Unmanned Traffic Management are inside the scope, but nothing else. Features like flight management, and tracking hardware, are explicitly out of the scope.
